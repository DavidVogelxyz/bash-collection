# "counting" and "associative-arrays"

These scripts were both originally written on 2024 August 21, Wednesday.

`counting` was a simple script to test iterating in Bash.

`associative-arrays` was a continuation of counting, attempting to use an associative array to echo different lines as the script counted. It was never completed -- the script doesn't actually work as intended. However, it was an attempt to learn the Bash syntax for associative arrays, so it's being included as a learning experience.

For future reference, an "associative array" is essentially a hashmap.
