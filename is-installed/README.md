# is-installed

This script was originally completed on 2023 December 2, Saturday.

`is-installed` is a small project intended to test the concept of a "Linux utility".

The idea is that, using one small Bash script, a user can easily perform a bunch of functions. In addition, there would be a lean terminal user interface (TUI) to work with.
