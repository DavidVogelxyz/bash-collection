# ufw-firewall-rules

This script was originally completed on 2024 August 7, Wednesday.

`ufw-firewall-rules` was created to simplify the process of creating firewall rules in UFW.

The script can be given a list of IPs and ports, and it will create an IP-specific firewall rule on all the ports given. This is especially helpful when working with server projects where a handful of IP addresses need to be whitelisted so they can access the server.
