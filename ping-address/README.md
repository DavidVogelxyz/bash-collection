# ping-address

This script was originally completed on 2024 May 21, Tuesday.

`ping-address` is a simple script that allows a user to ping a list of "colloquial names" and IP addresses.

This was useful in a case where it was necessary to quickly and repeatedly test networking against a list of different servers in different locations. The script would loop through the list, identify which server was being pinged, and then attempt to ping that server.
