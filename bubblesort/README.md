# bubblesort

This script was originally completed on 2024 June 26, Wednesday.

`bubblesort` was a script written while bored on a Wednesday night. It was a quick attempt at implementing the "bubble sort" algorithm, in Bash.

The script includes two versions of the "bubble sort" algorithm: a first attempt (`bubblesort`), and a second, faster implementation (`bubblesort-faster`).

The second version is faster due to the addition of the "flags" -- once the algorithm detects that the array is sorted, it stops. The first version would continue to iterate until finished, even if already completely sorted.
